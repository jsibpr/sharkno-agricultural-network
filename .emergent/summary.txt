The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned a vague project idea into a tangible, running application. Initially, the AI debugged corrupted RAR files, identifying that a provided Java Spring Boot project skeleton was unusable. It then adeptly pivoted to utilize an existing FastAPI and React setup, re-implementing the core professional networking features, adapting them for the agricultural industry as per user refinement. A significant portion of the trajectory involved meticulously guiding the user through local environment setup on Windows, resolving numerous path, dependency, and startup issues. The AI then successfully implemented the foundational LinkedIn integration, including a mock LinkedIn Learning certificate import feature, before the summary request. The process demonstrates robust troubleshooting and a structured approach to feature development and user support.

The user initially provided a draft project called SharkNo Core aiming to be a professional network for validating professional capabilities through third parties. The core problem is to build a tool for validating professional capabilities.

After an initial  file was found to be an empty Java project, a second  provided a complete microservices architecture (Spring Boot for Auth, Files, Mail, Notification, and a Vue.js frontend). The user refined the vision: not to build agricultural technology, but to adapt the existing professional networking platform for people from the agricultural industry, focusing on agricultural professionals (farmers, agronomists, consultants) connecting and validating skills. Future connection with a project called NYVA was mentioned.

Current Implementation Scope (adapted SharkNo):
-   **Core Professional Networking Platform:** User profiles, third-party validation, professional services, file management (for certificates, portfolios).
-   **Agricultural Adaptation:** User profiles include agricultural capabilities, services are agriculture-focused, validation for agricultural expertise.
-   **Integrations (Planned/Started):**
    -   **Social Profile Integration:** LinkedIn API (profile sync, experience import).
    -   **Experience Validation:** LinkedIn Learning certificates, University APIs, Professional Bodies.
    -   **Subscription Platform:** Monetization via tiers (planned for later).
    -   **Enhanced Validation:** Digital credential verification, blockchain certificates.
    -   **Future:** NYVA project integration.

-   **Process Management:** Supervisor for running backend and frontend in background.
-   **API Integration:** OAuth 2.0 (specifically Authlib for LinkedIn).
-   **Cloud Deployment Concepts:** Differences between local and cloud, Vercel, Railway, MongoDB Atlas.
-   **Version Control:** Git and GitHub.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a full-stack application with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, utilizing MongoDB for the database. The previous AI engineer effectively re-implemented the features found in a provided Java microservices  file into this Python/JavaScript stack.



**Key File Modifications/Creations and their Importance:**
-   : Rewritten to include FastAPI endpoints for user management (login, register, current user), profile operations, service management, and critically, new endpoints for LinkedIn OAuth flow, profile data synchronization, experience import, and LinkedIn Learning certificate import. This file defines the backend's entire API contract.
-   : Updated to include , , and  for LinkedIn integration.
-   : Updated to include , , , and  for external API configuration.
-   : Modified to include routing for all new pages (, ) and to pass user data to components. It acts as the central routing and state management for the frontend.
-   : Modified to add the Integrations link to the main navigation menu, making the feature accessible in the UI.
-   : A new component created to manage and display various third-party integrations, with a primary focus on LinkedIn. It handles the UI for connecting/disconnecting LinkedIn, syncing experience, and importing LinkedIn Learning certificates. It was initially simplified and then expanded, and finally adjusted to always show the LinkedIn Learning demo.
-   : A new component created to provide a detailed privacy policy, a necessary requirement for third-party API integrations like LinkedIn.
-   , , , : Created to provide comprehensive project documentation, version control ignore rules, containerization setup, and GitHub integration instructions.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Phase 2 (LinkedIn Integration) Completion:**
    -   Obtain and configure real LinkedIn API Client ID and Client Secret in .
    -   Fully test the LinkedIn profile connection and data synchronization with real LinkedIn accounts.
-   **Phase 3: Enhanced Validation (Next in Queue):**
    -   Implement University Credential Verification APIs.
    -   Implement Professional Certification Validation APIs (e.g., USDA, organic certifications).
    -   Develop Multi-source Validation mechanisms.
    -   Consider Blockchain Certificates (future).
-   **Phase 4: Advanced Features (After Phase 3):**
    -   Develop advanced analytics for premium users.
    -   Implement API access for enterprise users.
    -   Provide white-label options.
    -   Plan and implement NYVA integration.
-   **Subscription Platform (Last Phase):**
    -   Integrate Stripe for payment processing.
    -   Implement agricultural subscription tiers.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was working on troubleshooting and finalizing the local setup and the LinkedIn integration for the SharkNo Agricultural Professional Network.

The current state of the product is as follows:
-   **Backend (FastAPI)**: Running on . It handles user authentication, profile management, services, and has the backend logic for LinkedIn OAuth, profile sync, and LinkedIn Learning certificate import. It's configured with placeholder LinkedIn API keys, so actual LinkedIn connection attempts will fail with invalid client_id errors.
-   **Frontend (React)**: Running on  (or  if port  was busy). It displays the SharkNo Agricultural Professional Network UI, which includes:
    -   A working login and registration system.
    -   Dashboard, Profile, Services, Validations, and Search pages.
    -   A newly added Integrations page in the navigation.
    -   The Integrations page itself is now correctly rendered and fully visible.
    -   On the Integrations page, the Connect LinkedIn button is present but will produce an error if clicked due to the placeholder API keys.
    -   **Crucially**, the 📚 Import Learning Certificates button is now visible (after the last fix to  to always render this section). Clicking this button successfully imports and displays **three mock agricultural certificates**, demonstrating the LinkedIn Learning integration's functionality without requiring live LinkedIn API keys.
    -   A Privacy Policy page has been created and is accessible at , fulfilling a LinkedIn developer requirement.
-   **Local Environment**: The user has successfully installed Git, Python, Node.js, and MongoDB on their Windows machine, and has been guided through starting both the backend and frontend servers locally.
-   **Nuances**: The LinkedIn API integration currently uses mock data and placeholder credentials. While the UI and backend logic are in place, full end-to-end testing with a real LinkedIn account requires obtaining and configuring actual LinkedIn Developer credentials. The coming soon messages for other integrations (GitHub, Google) and experience sync are still present as those features are not yet implemented.

The next step is to continue with Phase 3: Enhanced Validation, as per the user's explicit request.
